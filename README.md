# 📊 Financial Planning & Forecasting Project

### 👤 Project Owner : Putanyn Manee 🇹🇭 🙇🏻‍♂️

This project is all about building a powerful and flexible financial planning and forecasting system, designed to help organizations (starting with Apple for advanced analysis and TXT for basic analysis) better predict future performance, allocate resources, and manage financial risk. While the project is still in progress, here's a sneak peek into what’s coming up! 🚀

## 📝 What I’m Aiming to Do

### 🔍 **Historical Analysis**
First things first—understanding the past. This involves digging into historical financial performance to identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses. This step is all about making sure the foundation is solid before diving into the future. 

### 🔧 **Assumption Setting**
Next, I’ll define the key assumptions that will drive the forecast. These could be anything from projected revenue growth to cost increases, interest rates, and more. These assumptions will set the stage for the models I’ll be building later. 🎯

### 🛠️ **Model Building**
This is where the magic happens—creating financial models that project future performance based on historical data and assumptions. I’m focusing on building:
- **Financial Forecasting Models**: These will project future income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows based on the assumptions and historical data.
- **Budgeting Models**: These will help allocate resources and set financial targets across departments or for the organization as a whole.

### 🔄 **Scenario Analysis**
What if things don’t go as planned? Scenario analysis allows me to test different possible outcomes based on varying assumptions. By building these scenarios into the model, I can explore the potential impacts of different decisions or external factors on the company's future financial health. 🔮

## 🔢 **Planned Models**

- **📈 Financial Forecasting Model**: A model that projects future financial statements based on assumptions and historical data.
- **💰 Budgeting Model**: A resource allocation model that sets financial targets for departments or the entire organization.

---

## 🛠️ **Expected Output**

- **Financial Projections**: Forecasted income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements to give a clear picture of future financial performance.
- **Budget Reports**: Detailed budgets to help departments or the whole organization stay on track financially.
- **Scenario Analysis Reports**: These reports will analyze different financial scenarios and highlight their implications, helping in decision-making.

## 🔬 **Advancing the Project**

I’m also working on incorporating more advanced techniques to push the forecasting to the next level. Here’s what’s planned:

### 🌐 **Integrated Financial Planning Models**
Building a fully integrated model that links the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement together. This dynamic approach will allow for real-time scenario planning and sensitivity analysis. 🎯

### 🎲 **Monte Carlo Simulations**
I plan to integrate Monte Carlo simulations into the forecasting models to assess the probability distribution of various outcomes. This will provide a deeper understanding of risks and uncertainties by simulating hundreds or thousands of possible scenarios. 📊

### 🤖 **Machine Learning Forecasting Models**
For a more nuanced approach, I’ll explore machine learning techniques like Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM networks. These models will help forecast financial metrics in a more complex and accurate way, especially useful when dealing with large datasets and non-linear trends. 📡

### 🔑 **Driver-Based Planning**
This approach revolves around key business drivers (e.g., price, volume, costs), making the forecasts more actionable and aligned with strategic goals. This method will help pinpoint the exact levers that influence financial performance. 🎯

### 🧠 **Portfolio Differentiator**
I’ll present a sophisticated multi-scenario financial forecasting model using Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning techniques, demonstrating how to handle complexity and uncertainty in financial planning. 📊

## ⚙️ Current Focus

I’m currently focusing on:
- **Apple**: This is where I’m diving into advanced methods like Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning models.
- **TXT**: This is being used for basic modeling and building out the foundational models.

*Note: If anything doesn’t work out as planned, I’ll be tweaking the approach or even switching companies—flexibility is key here!*
